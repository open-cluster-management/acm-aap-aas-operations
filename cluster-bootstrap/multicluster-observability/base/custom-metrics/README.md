# Custom Metrics

This application will deploy the custom metrics for AAP monitoring after you have enabled the observability service by creating a MultiClusterObservability CustomResource (CR) instance, then you can use these custom metrics to desing your dashboard or alert rules. Now we just add all metrics we need them currently. For more information, see [Adding custom metrics](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html/observability/observing-environments-intro#adding-custom-metrics).
