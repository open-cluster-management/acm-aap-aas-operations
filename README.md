# ACM AAPaaS Operations Repo

This repository contains artifacts, OpenShift GitOps applications, policy, conrfiguration, dashboards, and more - all involved with operating the ACM hub management layer on top of the AAPaaS offering.

## Deploying Hub Services on a New Cluster(Deprecated. Please reference to the GitOps deployment [here](./cluster-bootstrap/README.md))

This repository is currenlty a semi-manual deploy process, and will continue to require manual steps until we configure a shared vault instance for secret storage and injection.

If you wish to deploy a new hub with all of the operators, services, and configurations present in this repository, you'll need to deploy each components pre-reqs, then the GitOps application itself and, in some cases, postinstall objects (like CRs that require secrets).

The recommended order is as follows:
1. Deploy OpenShift GitOps by running `oc apply -k ./prereqs/openshift-gitops-operator` followed by `oc apply -k ./prereqs/openshift-gitops-configuration`.
2. Deploy Cert-Manger.  The Cert-Manager prereqs and postinstall instructions can be found in the [cert-manager GitOps application README](./operators/cert-manager/README.md).
3. Deploy Group-Sync.  The Group-Sync prereqs and postinstall instructions can be found in the [group-sync GitOps application README](./operators/group-sync/README.md).
4. Deploy Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.  The RHACM prereqs and install instructions can be found in the [RHACM GitOps application README](./operators/red-hat-advanced-cluster-management/README.md).
5. Deploy MultiClusterObservability.  The Observability prereqs and install instructions can be found in the [MCO GitOps applicaton README](./operators/multiclusterobservability/README.md).
6. Deploy Identity Configuration Management for Kubernetes.  The IDP Config Management prereqs and postinstall instruciton can be found in the [IDP Config Management GitOps application README](./operators/identity-configuration-management-for-kubernetes/README.md).
7. [OPTIONAL] Deploy Ansible Automation Platform to the Hub.  The AAP prereqs and install instructions can be found in the [AAP GitOps application README](./operators/ansible-automation-platform/README.md).
8. [OPTIONAL] Deploy RBAC configurations to the hub.  To accomplish this, simply `oc apply -k ./gitops-applications/rbac` (after configuring your github.secret as described in the [README](./gitops-applications/rbac/README.md)).
9. [OPTIONAL] Deploy cluster-logging on the hub to foreward logs to ELK stack. `oc apply -k ./gitops-application/cluster-logging`. Once you setup github.secrets in previous steps, the repo is already registered with Argo.
10. [OPTIONAL] Deploy `cluster-backup-operator` on the hub the instruction can be found in [`cluster-backup-operator` README](./operators/cluster-backup/README.md))

## Deploying ACM Applications and Policies on the Hub to Configure Managed Clusters

Once you have a new hub online, you can start bringing managed cluster components under the ACM Hub's management. This will involve deploying hub-side configurations (via OpenShift GitOps) which will create ACM Applications and Policies and push configurations to the managed cluster.

To deploy these configurations, do the following:
1. Deploy the ACM Application channel - this construct defines a source for artifacts for an ACM application.  In this case, the channel will point at this repository!  This GitOps application requries that you create a pull secret for private repos using the instrucitons found in the [acm-channel README](./acm-applications/subscriptions/.prereqs/README.md).  Once the secret has been created, simply `oc apply -k ./gitops-applications/acm-channel`.
2. Deploy the ACM AAP Application itself, this references the channel you created earlier.  This is also a simple, no-prereqs, GitOps deploy!  Simply `oc apply -k ./gitops-applications/acm-aap-application`.  `oc label managedcluster <managed-cluster-name> ansible-automation-platform="true"` for all managed clusters you wish to deploy the AAP application to.
